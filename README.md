# PeerStream
A video streaming and messaging network application containing server and clients. A course project for Computer Networks CS348.

## Problem Statement
Design and implement a socket programming system where a server manages client connections, maintains a dictionary mapping client names to public keys and facilitates secure communication and video streaming among clients. The system should allow clients to communicate with each other through the server securely, notify existing clients of new connections, and enable secure one-to-one communication by requesting public keys from the server for encryption. Additionally, the server should stream a video file requested by a client without actually saving the file at the clientâ€™s end.
